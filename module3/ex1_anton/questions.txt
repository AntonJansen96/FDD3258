I have written the Hello World code in C++. To compile the MPI code:

on local machine    mpic++
on Beskow           CC

No specific compiler flags are required.

To run the MPI code:

on local machine    mpiexec -n <processes> main
on Beskow           srun -n <processes> main

To change the number of MPI processes, change the value of -n when calling
mpiexec (local) or srun (beskow).

The functions used for retrieving the rank of an MPI process and the total
number of processes are (respectively): MPI_Comm_size() and MPI_Comm_rank().

The names of the most used MPI implementations are MPICH and OpenMPI.
